      <p class="text">Edgar had a strong passion in music throughout his whole life. He started playing the clarinet in 5th grade and developed a passion of playing the clarinet. While on his journey throughout middle school and elementary school, he picked up the bass clarinet and tenor saxophone and played for multiple honor and jazz bands. While playing music, Edgar developed an interest in the technical aspect of music. Thus, Edgar started experimenting with his laptop to make some instrumentals and discovered the art of recording and mixing music. Therefore, he started researching about music technology and took summer courses on the art of recording music. To pursue this passion, he is now attending the University of Hartford, studying in Audio Engineering Technology with a Digital Media Technology minor.</p>
