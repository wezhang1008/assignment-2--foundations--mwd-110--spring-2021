            <h3>Who the hell is this guy?</h3>
               <p>Ryan Cunningham has worked with sound since he was a young tween. Messing with Tascam Portastudios and polishing sonic turds was the name of the game by the time he got accepted to the Audio Engineering Technology program at the University of Hartford. Upon arriving on campus, he quickly cozied up to on-campus organizations such as WWUH and WSAM, enjoying the parasitic relationship of knobtweaking in exchange for studio time (got em!). As the Production Director for WSAM he has worked with artists such as Frankie Cosmos, Crumb, Palm, Open Mike Eagle, as well as countless local acts in the Hartford area.</p>
